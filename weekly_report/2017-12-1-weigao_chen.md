## What I did this week are as follows:
- Paper Research
- Pantent Edit
-  Code about deep learning

### Abstract
    At the start of this weekday(Day01 - Day02),I read a paper named "You Only Look Once"(YOLO) about Object Detection algrorism,on Day03,there were some courses,I did the code work in the evening,Day04 is the meeting,today is Day05.
### Introduction
    Human glance at an image and instantly know waht objects are in the image,where they are,and how they interact.Fast,accurate and excellent performance algorithms would allow computer to do the same thing as human.What I researched is the starting of this:Object Detection.There is an idea that we can realize it with the deeplearning tools such as CNN,RNN and so on.
    Current research in our laboratory is OPENCV,the principal person is Han Yishen and Wangzhuo,they use the classical ways which emphasis on strategy ranther than machine learning.There is great potential in this research.
    Second,one of the most important work is to release the classical NETWORK such as VGG-Net,GooLeNet,so I did this work.
    Third,I learned something about proc file system.
### Object Detection
    I will implement this model in three weeks on Python if everything goes well.At the start of this work,I need to konw some details about OpenCV.
